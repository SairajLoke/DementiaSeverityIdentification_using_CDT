# DementiaSeverityIdentification_using_CDT
project code made for a kaggle competition



Background
Dementia is one of the most common neurocognitive syndromes in the world, in which the memory and the ability to perform daily life activities deteriorate and get worse.
If detected early, it can help in better management of the disease and can save a person from a lifelong dependency on severe medication.

Clock Drawing Test - CDT
The CDT is a proven preliminary test for detection of neurocognitive diseases like dementia. The patient is given a pen and a paper and he is asked to draw an analog clock on it and show the time "11:10". Based on how the patient draws, a medical practitioner can detect the chances of the patient suffering from dementia.

Goal of the competition
Participants have to digitalise the process of CDT by using deep learning models utilising the dataset of hand-drawn clock images. Severity of the disease is specified in range 0-5 (0 indicating the worst case and 5 showing no sign of Dementia.)
